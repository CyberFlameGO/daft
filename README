Daft Proxy is a simple "Do as told" HTTP proxy.

The proxy does what the configuration files (so called test cases)
tell it to do. Each test case is a piece of Javascript code that
overwrites default proxy methods or types. A test case may modify
messages while they are forwarded or even prevent their forwarding
(e.g., to simulate caching or mimic a broken proxy). This behavior
is handy for testing software that has to work with HTTP proxies.

Without a configuration file, the proxy forwards each message "as is",
except for adding the required Via header field.

Daft Proxy listens on IPv4 port 3128 and forwards all messages to
localhost:80. To customize, modify Config.js.


Daft proxy requires Javascript 6 (i.e., ECMAScript 6).

Usage:

    babel proxy/test1.js > proxy/test1.js5 && ./proxy/index.js proxy/test1.js5
